# Introduction to JAX library

This repository serves as an introductory guide to the JAX library, developed by Google. JAX is a powerful open-source library designed for numerical computing, machine learning, and scientific computing. It combines the ease of use of NumPy with the ability to execute computations on accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.

The notebook tries to display the fundamental concepts of JAX and learn how to leverage its capabilities for efficient and scalable computation. The code examples provided demonstrate various JAX functionalities, enabling you to grasp the library's core features and apply them in practical scenarios.

Topics covered in this repository include:

* Basics of JAX arrays (jax.numpy)
* Automatic Differentiation with JAX
* JAX transformations for transforming functions
* GPU/TPU acceleration with JAX

By exploring these topics and running the code examples, the code provides a hands-on experience with JAX and its various functionalities. This repository aims to provide a solid foundation for anyone interested in using JAX for scientific computing, machine learning, or numerical simulations.
